My Research Topic:

**Is Suicideper100TH associated with Internet Users Rate in Myanmar?**



After looking through the codebook for the _GapMinder_ study, I have decided that I am particularly interested in Suicideper100TH variable in relation to Internet Users rate especially in my country, Myanmar.

Since 2010, the Internet Users rate has exponentially increased in Myanmar, and youngsters are more and more on-line. This research is intended to understand the relation to suicidal behaviors in youngsters due to depression and other related factors.

There are some papers which pointed out the relation of these two factors in different countries. For example, **The levels of depression and suicide ideation were highest in the Internet-addicts group.** - the statement pointed out by the researchers after done the research on adolescents in Korea (Zhao F etlc., 2017).

Therefore, I believe that there is strong relationship between these two variables. The codebook for the dataset are shown below.

As for the second topic, I would like to figure out the *femaleemployrate* is realated to  *polityscore* of the specific country.
